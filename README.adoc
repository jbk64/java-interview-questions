== General java knowledge

=== What is Java?
Java refers to both a language and a software platform.

=== What is the Java programming language?

Java is a general-purpose *programming language* that is *object-oriented* and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

It is intended to let developers "write once, run anywhere", meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

The rules for writing a correct implementation of the Java language are defined in the link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/[Java Language Specification] (JLS).

=== What is the Java platform?
Java also refers to a *set of specifications* that provide a system for developing software applications and running them in a cross-platform environment.

Java is not specific to any processor or operating system as the Java platform has been implemented for a wide variety of hardware and operating systems.

Java is exists in 3 versions:

* *Java SE* (Standard Edition)
* *Java EE* (Enterprise Edition)
* *Java ME* (Mobile Edition)

=== What is the JDK?

The *Java Development Kit* is a tool kit that provides tools necessary to compile, document and package Java programs.

The tools provided by the SDK include a compiler (`javac`), an archiver (`jar`), a documentation generator (`javadoc`) and other tools needed in Java development.

The JRE is required to _develop_ Java programs.

=== What is the JRE?

The *Java Runtime Environment* implements the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and provides the class libraries and other support files required by the JVM to run Java programs.

The JRE is required to _run_ Java programs.

=== What is the JVM?

The JVM is a *virtual machine* that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages. A valid JVM implementation must meet the requirements laid out by a detailed specification.

The JVM can run programs written in other languages than Java. These languages include Clojure, Groovy and Scala to only name a few.

The JVM reference implementation, called HotSpot, is developed by the OpenJDK project as open source code and includes a JIT compiler.

Running a Java program with the `java` command starts a JVM runtime instance as an operating system process of the physical computer. After the runtime environment is setup, the program is launched inside this environment empty of any other program.

=== What is just-in-time compilation?

Just-in-time compilation is a way of executing computer code that involves compilation during runtime rather than prior to execution.

A system that uses JIT-compilation typically continuously analyses the code being executed and identifies parts of the code where the speedup gained from compilation or recompilation would outweigh the overhead of compiling that code.

It is a combination of the two traditional approaches to translation to machine code (ahead-of-time compilation (AOT) and interpretation) and combines some advantages and drawbacks of both.

=== What is the lifecycle of a Java application?

Java source code is written as human-readable code in .java files.

The source code is then converted to JVM bytecode using `javac`, the Java compiler. This produces .class files, which contain machine-independent instructions. These files are then interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine at runtime when executing the program.

=== What are the differences between final, finally and finalize?

`final` is used for read-only fields, classes that should not have subclasses, or methods that should not be overwritten.

`finally` is part of the `try/catch` structure to denote code that should always run, whether an exception was thrown or not.

`finalize` is called by the garbage collector on an object when it has determined that there are not more references to it. In most code, it should not be used. `finalize` is deprecated starting with Java 9, and will eventually be removed.

=== Java Garbage Collector

The garbage collector (GC) is an automatic internal process implemented inside the JVM that handles objects at the end of their lifecycle.

When an object is no longer needed to run the program, the GC marks it as ready for garbage collection. In a second step, all marked objects are deleted from memory.

The HotSpot JVM operates under the _Weak Generational Hypothesis_, which says that most objects have very short lifecycles and become unused very quickly, and the ones that survive are required for a very long time.

Based on this hypothesis, the memory inside the JVM is divided into separate and individually cleanable areas reserved for different types of objects.

=== Forcing garbage collection

You can make garbage collection happen on the spot by using the `System.gc` method. This method should not be invoked in most real-world systems, for multiple reasons:

. it's costly
. it doesn't trigger the GC immediately, it is just a hint for the JVM to start GC,
. the JVM knows better when GC needs to happen.

=== Errors, Exceptions, Checked vs. Unchecked

`Exception` and `Error` both inherit from `Throwable`, which itself inherits from `Object`.

`Exception` is short for _exceptional event_. They represent conditions that a reasonable application might want to catch. They could cause the termination of the program but are recoverable using try, catch and throw structures. There are two types of exceptions:

. Unchecked exceptions are `RuntimeException` and its subclasses. These may occur at any time during runtime, and are not known by the compiler at compile time.
. Checked exceptions are known to the compiler at compile time. They include `ClassNotFoundException` and `FileNotFoundException`.

`Error` events should not be caught or handled (except in the rarest of cases). They indicate serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch, such as `OutOfMemoryError` (the JVM has run out of memory).

=== How does String concatenation act differently to using the StringBuilder class

The JVM optimizes trivial String concatenations by converting them to StringBuilder under the hood.

This means that...
```
String myString = "test";
myString += "add this to the string";
```

...is the same (memory-wise) as:
```
StringBuilder test = new StringBuilder("test");
test.append("add this to the string");
```

On the other hand, if you do non-simple concatenations (like concatenating inside a loop), it is more efficient to use the StringBuilder.

== Java EE

=== What is Java EE?

Java EE is short for Java Platform, Enterprise Edition.

It is a community-driven set of specifications for building enterprise software. The specifications are developed using the Java Community Process, with contributions from industry experts, commercial and open source organizations, and countless individuals.

The Java EE set of specifications extends Java SE with enterprise features such as distributed programming and web services.

Java EE applications run on reference runtimes, that can be microservices or application servers, which handle transactions, security, scalability, concurrency and management of the deployed components.

=== Java EE Specifications

Java EE includes several specifications that extend the functionality of the base Java SE APIs.

Here are a few examples.

*Web specifications*:

* Servlet: loq level API that defines how to manage HTTP requests. Many other APIs rely on it.
* *WebSocket* defines a set of APIs to service WebSocket connections.
* *Java Server Faces*, a technology for building user interfaces out of components.
* *Unified Expression Language*, a simple language to bind JSF components to beans

*Web service specifications*:

* *JAX-RS* provides support in creating web services according to Representational State Transfer principles.
* *JAX-WS* provides support in creating SOAP web services.
* *JSON-P* Java API for Json Processing

*Enterprise specifications*:

* *Contexts and Dependency Injection* specifications to provide a dependency injection container, as in Spring,
* *EJB* (Enterprise JavaBean) defines EJB containers that provide transactions (using JTA), RPC calls, concurrency control, dependency injection and access control for business objects.
* *JPA* (Java Persistence API) are specifications about object-relational mapping between database tables and Java classes.
* *JTA* (Java Transaction API) provides support for transactions,
* *Java Message Service* provides a common way for Java programs to create, send, receive and read enterprise messaging system's messages.
