= Java Interview Questions

== General Java Knowledge

=== What is Java?
Java refers to both a language and a software platform.

=== What is the Java programming language?

Java is a general-purpose *programming language* that is *object-oriented* and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

It is intended to let developers "*write once, run anywhere*", meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

The rules for writing a correct implementation of the Java language are defined in the link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/[Java Language Specification] (JLS).

=== What is the Java platform?
Java also refers to a *set of specifications* that provide a system for developing software applications and running them in a cross-platform environment.

Java is *not specific to any processor or operating system* as the Java platform has been implemented for a wide variety of hardware and operating systems.

Java is exists in 3 versions:

* *Java SE* (Standard Edition)
* *Java EE* (Enterprise Edition)
* *Java ME* (Mobile Edition)

=== What is the JDK?

The *Java Development Kit* is a tool kit that provides tools necessary to compile, document and package Java programs.

The tools provided by the SDK include a *compiler* (`javac`), an *archiver* (`jar`), a *documentation generator* (`javadoc`) and other tools needed in Java development.

The JRE is required to _develop_ Java programs.

=== What is the JRE?

The *Java Runtime Environment* implements the *Java Virtual Machine* (JVM) and provides the *class libraries* and *other support files* required by the JVM to run Java programs.

=== What is the JVM?

The JVM is a *virtual machine* that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages. A valid JVM implementation must meet the requirements laid out by a detailed specification.

The JVM can run programs written in other languages than Java. These languages include Clojure, Groovy and Scala to only name a few.

The JVM reference implementation, called HotSpot, is developed by the OpenJDK project as open source code and includes a JIT compiler.

Running a Java program with the `java` command starts a JVM runtime instance as an operating system process of the physical computer. After the runtime environment is setup, the program is launched inside this environment empty of any other program.

=== What is just-in-time compilation?

Just-in-time compilation is a way of executing computer code that involves compilation during runtime rather than prior to execution.

A systen that uses JIT-compilation typically continuously analyses the code being executed and identifies parts of the code where the speedup gained from compilation or recompilation would outweigh the overhead of compiling that code.

It is a combination of the two traditional approaches to translation to machine code (*ahead-of-time compilation (AOT)* and *interpretation*) and combines some advantages and drawbacks of both.

=== What is the lifecycle of a Java application?

Java source code is written as human-readable code in .java files.

The *source code is then converted to JVM bytecode* using `javac`, the Java compiler. This produces .class files, which contain machine-independent instructions. These files are then interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine at runtime when executing the program.
